# Pad Thai
### this originated from the recipe in the Big Bowl cookbook, and then has been twisted over the years to satisfy teenage boys.
### you need a big wok for this
### this batch will feed 2 or 3 people and it is very difficult to make it bigger

- 2+ chicken breasts cut into cubes
- 1 TBS sesame oil (optional)
- peanut oil (not optional, but you could use another neutral oil)
- 1-2 eggs, scrambled
- 3/4 of a bag of rice noodles 
- 3 cups bean sprouts
- 1 bundle of green onions
- 1 cup peanuts
- soy sauce
- fresh thai basil (if you can find it, no biggie if you can't)
- 1-2 tablespoon basil (the regular dry stuff)
- 2-3 limes (for juice, so get juicy ones)
- chili-garlic sauce (Huy Fong brand - bright red stuff with a rooster on it and green cap)
- fish sauce
- brown sugar (white could work, but brown tastes better)

### Prep
1. soak the noodles in a bowl of really hot water for about 20-30m.  when they are al dente, strain them
1. chop the green onions small all the way down until it is fully white.  if you like it onion-ey chop the white parts too.
1. if you found fresh thai basil, chop up 1/4 cup of it
1. chop or crush the peanuts.  i put them in a ziplock, put it on a towel or cutting board, and hammer it with the spikey side of a meat tenderizer.
1. The Sauce- this part varies every time, and I am just guessing these numbers - i go by feel and color.  Some people like things sweeter, some sour, some hot, etc etc this is where that all happens so tweak as you like.
  1. juice the limes and pour into a bowl
  1. add 2 tablespoons of chili-garlic
  1. add 3-4 tablespoons of fish sauce
  1. add 1/4 cup of brown sugar
  1. mix it up well, the brown sugar will want to settle at the bottom

### Cook
__This next part happens pretty fast.  Mise en place is very important!__
1. fire up the wok (HIGH) with a couple tablespoons of peanut oil, add the chicken and optional sesame oil
1. once the chicken is fully cooked move it to the outside of the wok, there should be some liquid and oil at the bottom
1. drop in the eggs and don't touch them for a minute or two.  once you can see they are getting mostly cooked, go ahead and mix it all up with the chicken.
1. add the noodles and cook for 1 or 2 minutes - keep it constantly moving or it will stick
1. add the sauce (you usually have to scrape out the gooey bottom)
1. start folding it to mix and as soon as it's mixed (maybe 30 seconds)
1. kill the burner
1. add the bean sprouts and green onions.  fold.
1. add the peanuts. fold.
1. add 1-2 tablespoons of soy. fold.
1. add basil (fresh if you have it + 1 tablespoon of dry, or just 2 dry)
1. fold one last time and you're done.
